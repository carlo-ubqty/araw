DATA SOURCE ARCHITECTURE: EXCEL VS NORMALIZED DATABASE
========================================================

CONTEXT UPDATE: Most data sources will be Excel files rather than APIs
Architectural Decision Required: Process Excel files directly vs migrate to normalized database

RECOMMENDED APPROACH: HYBRID STRATEGY
======================================

PHASE 1: Excel Processing Foundation (Sprints 1-4)
• Start with Excel files for rapid MVP development
• Faster time-to-market (2-3 weeks vs 6-8 weeks for full ETL)
• Stakeholders maintain familiar Excel-based workflow
• Lower initial complexity - no schema design needed immediately
• Quick dashboard demonstration for stakeholder buy-in

Technical Implementation:
• Data Processing: Pandas (Python) or SheetJS (Node.js)
• Storage: File-based with metadata indexing
• Update Process: Manual upload or scheduled file processing
• Query Engine: In-memory processing with caching

PHASE 2: Selective Normalization (Sprints 5-8)
• Normalize high-volume and frequently-queried datasets
• Priority datasets for database migration:
  - Core financial data (BTr, DBM, DOF datasets)
  - GHG emissions data (for trend analysis)
  - LGU data (for geospatial analysis)
  - High-frequency update sources

PHASE 3: Full Normalization (Sprints 9-12)
• Complete database migration for production scalability
• Performance optimization and advanced analytics

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
=====================

EXCEL FILES DIRECT APPROACH

Advantages:
• Rapid Development: 2-3x faster initial implementation
• Familiar Workflow: Agencies continue Excel-based processes
• Low Barrier to Entry: No schema design or ETL complexity
• Flexible Schema: Handles varying data structures easily
• Quick Prototyping: Dashboard mockups with real data fast

Disadvantages:
• Performance Issues: Slow with large files (>10MB per file)
• Complex Analytics: Difficult joins across 165+ files
• Scalability Problems: Memory limitations with government-scale data
• Data Quality: No automated validation or consistency checks
• Version Control: Hard to track data changes and updates
• Security Concerns: File-based access control limitations

NORMALIZED DATABASE APPROACH

Advantages:
• High Performance: Optimized queries across all data sources
• Complex Analytics: Easy joins, aggregations, trend analysis
• Scalability: Handles growth in data volume and users
• Data Integrity: Validation, constraints, audit trails
• Real-time Updates: Can implement live data refresh
• Advanced Features: Full-text search, geospatial queries

Disadvantages:
• Development Time: 3-4x longer initial setup
• Schema Complexity: Need to design unified data model
• ETL Overhead: Complex transformation pipelines
• Change Management: Harder to modify structure later

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
========================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 2 Sprints):

1. Excel Processing Implementation
   • Technology: Python + Pandas or Node.js + SheetJS
   • Architecture: File upload → Process → Cache → Visualize
   • Timeline: Working dashboard in 3-4 weeks

2. Database Schema Design (Parallel Development)
   • Focus: Core entities (Projects, Funding, Agencies, LGUs)
   • Tools: PostgreSQL with proper indexing strategy
   • Timeline: Schema ready by Sprint 3

3. Hybrid Data Layer Architecture
   • Hot Data: Frequently accessed → Database
   • Cold Data: Archives, reference → File-based
   • Real-time: API endpoints → Database
   • Bulk Historical: Excel files → Database via ETL

UPDATED TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
===============================

Data Processing Pipeline:
Excel Upload → Data Validation → Format Standardization → 
Database Storage → API Layer → Dashboard

Technology Stack Changes:
• Excel Processing: Pandas (Python) or ExcelJS (Node.js)
• ETL Pipeline: Apache Airflow + custom transformers
• Database: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (time-series)
• Caching: Redis (processed Excel data)
• File Storage: AWS S3/Azure Blob (original Excel files)

Implementation Timeline:
• Week 1-2: Excel processing + basic dashboard
• Week 3-4: Database schema + core dataset migration  
• Week 5-8: Hybrid approach with critical data in DB
• Week 9-12: Full normalization + performance optimization

SUCCESS FACTORS FOR HYBRID APPROACH
====================================

1. START SIMPLE
   • Excel processing gets dashboard running quickly
   • Demonstrates value to stakeholders early
   • Builds momentum for project continuation

2. PLAN FOR SCALE
   • Design database schema early, implement gradually
   • Identify high-priority datasets for normalization
   • Monitor performance to guide migration priorities

3. DATA GOVERNANCE
   • Keep original Excel files as source of truth initially
   • Implement version control for Excel file updates
   • Establish data validation rules early

4. PERFORMANCE MONITORING
   • Track query times to identify normalization priorities
   • Monitor memory usage during Excel processing
   • Set performance benchmarks for database migration

5. STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
   • Show working dashboard early to maintain buy-in
   • Gradual transition minimizes workflow disruption
   • Provide training on new processes as they're implemented

RISK MITIGATION FOR EXCEL APPROACH
===================================

HIGH RISK: Performance Degradation
• Mitigation: Implement file size limits, pagination, aggressive caching
• Monitoring: Set up alerts for slow query performance

MEDIUM RISK: Data Inconsistency
• Mitigation: Standardized Excel templates, validation rules
• Process: Regular data quality audits and cleanup

MEDIUM RISK: Scalability Limitations
• Mitigation: Plan database migration timeline based on usage patterns
• Fallback: Prioritize most critical datasets for early migration

The hybrid approach provides the optimal balance of rapid development with long-term scalability, allowing the project to deliver value quickly while building toward a robust, enterprise-grade solution.
