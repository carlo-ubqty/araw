ORIGINAL DOF/UNDP MOCKUP ANALYSIS
=====================================
Date: 2025-09-29
Comparison vs. Current v3.0 Implementation

KEY LAYOUT DIFFERENCES OBSERVED:
================================

1. LEFT SIDEBAR STRUCTURE:
   - Full-height teal/green sidebar (not thin nav)
   - Multiple navigation sections vertically stacked
   - White text on dark green background
   - Appears to have expandable/collapsible sections

2. TOP NAVIGATION TABS:
   - NAP, NDCIP, BUDGET, PROJECTS tabs (4 total vs our 2)
   - Similar to our current dataset navigation but more tabs
   - Blue and green color scheme for active/inactive tabs

3. KPI CARDS LAYOUT:
   - 5 horizontal KPI cards across top
   - Different color schemes: Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow, Purple
   - Shows: 980 Mn, 56%, 700 Mn, 280 Mn, 579 Projects
   - Cards have gradient backgrounds and trend indicators

4. CHART GRID LAYOUT:
   - Dense 3-column grid layout
   - Multiple chart types: Line, Bar, Stacked Bar, Map, Bubble
   - Chart sections:
     * Funds Mobilized for Climate Action (line chart)  
     * GHG Levels (line chart)
     * Investments by Sector (stacked bar)
     * Fund Sources (bar chart) 
     * GHG CO2 Baseline by Sector (bar chart)
     * Investments by Region (horizontal bar)
     * Philippine Map visualization (choropleth)
     * Vulnerability/Climate Risk by Investment (bubble map)
     * Investment by Vulnerability Index (horizontal bar)

5. COLOR SCHEME:
   - Primarily teal/green sidebar
   - Multi-color KPI cards (not monochromatic teal)
   - Various chart colors per data type
   - White background content area

FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES:
======================
- More dataset categories (4 vs 2 tabs)
- Denser information display
- Different chart arrangements
- More comprehensive left navigation
- Integrated map + data visualizations

IMPACT ON CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
=================================
Current v3.0 implementation significantly differs from original:
- Simpler sidebar vs. full-height navigation
- Missing BUDGET and PROJECTS tabs
- Different chart layout (fewer charts displayed)
- Different color scheme application
- Less dense information architecture

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
Need to decide: Adapt current architecture to original design or restart with original as base template.
