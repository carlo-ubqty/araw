# AUTO-DEPLOY SYSTEM NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT

## CURRENT STATUS: REVERTED FOR DEMO STABILITY

**Date:** 2025-09-12 (Emergency Session)  
**Context:** Automation system was fully implemented but had to be reverted 20 minutes before user's demo due to critical Next.js hanging issues.

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED

### Problem: Next.js Production Hanging
- **Symptom**: `next start` processes hang on startup in production
- **PM2 Status**: Shows "online" but process not responding on port 3000
- **Network**: Nginx returns 502 Bad Gateway (can't connect to backend)
- **Impact**: Site completely inaccessible during user's demo deadline

### Emergency Resolution
- ‚úÖ **Automation Deleted**: All webhook scripts and PM2 processes removed
- ‚úÖ **Git Reset**: Reverted to commit `fd2642f` (stable "dashboard layout v1")  
- ‚úÖ **Clean Rebuild**: Fresh npm install + build + simple PM2 config
- ‚úÖ **Demo Saved**: Site restored to https://araw-qa.ncience.com in time

---

## üöÄ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED (Available in Git History)

### Auto-Deploy System Features
**Git Commit:** `10f036b` - "Add auto-deploy with rollback system"

#### 1. Webhook Server (`scripts/webhook-deploy.js`)
```javascript
// Features implemented:
- GitHub webhook endpoint (/webhook)
- Health check endpoint (/health)  
- Status endpoint (/status)
- Manual rollback endpoint (/rollback)
- Automatic state saving/restoration
- PM2 compatibility fixes for older versions
```

#### 2. Deployment Scripts
- **`scripts/setup-auto-deploy.sh`**: Automated setup on EC2
- **`scripts/rollback.sh`**: Manual rollback command
- **`scripts/test-rollback.sh`**: Testing script
- **`scripts/webhook.ecosystem.config.js`**: PM2 config for webhook

#### 3. Auto-Deploy Flow
1. **GitHub Push** ‚Üí Webhook trigger
2. **Save State** ‚Üí Backup current deployment
3. **Deploy** ‚Üí git pull + npm install + build + PM2 restart
4. **Health Check** ‚Üí Verify site responds
5. **Auto-Rollback** ‚Üí Restore previous state if failure

#### 4. Rollback System
- **Automatic**: Triggered by health check failures
- **Manual**: `/rollback` endpoint or command line script
- **State Management**: JSON files tracking last known good deployments

## üîç INVESTIGATION NEEDED FOR NEXT ATTEMPT

### Primary Issue: Next.js Hanging
**Potential Causes:**
1. **Node.js Version**: Next.js 15.5.3 compatibility with Node v18.x on EC2
2. **Memory Constraints**: EC2 instance resources during build/startup
3. **Port Conflicts**: Something blocking port 3000 access
4. **Build Mode**: Standard vs standalone build differences

**Recommended Investigation:**
```bash
# Check Node.js compatibility
node --version
npm ls next

# Test standalone build mode
# In next.config.ts:
export default {
  output: 'standalone'
}

# Try direct Node.js instead of npm start
node .next/standalone/server.js

# Monitor resource usage during startup
htop
netstat -tulpn | grep :3000
```

### PM2 Issues Resolved
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: PM2 version compatibility (`pm2 jlist` vs `pm2 show --json`)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Nested directory issues after git operations
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: File permissions and ownership

---

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED RE-IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Investigate Core Issue
1. **Create Staging Environment** (separate from demo site)
2. **Test Next.js Stability** with various configurations
3. **Identify Root Cause** of hanging processes
4. **Document Solution** before implementing automation

### Phase 2: Gradual Automation
1. **Basic Webhook** (no auto-restart, just git pull + build)
2. **Manual PM2 Restart** after verification
3. **Add Health Checks** once stability confirmed
4. **Full Auto-Deploy** with proven working components

### Phase 3: Production Rollout
1. **Test Thoroughly** on staging environment
2. **Backup Strategy** with verified rollback procedures  
3. **Monitoring** with comprehensive logging
4. **Gradual Deployment** during non-critical times

---

## üìã CURRENT WORKING DEPLOYMENT METHOD

**Proven Stable Process:**
```bash
# On EC2 server (/var/www/ubqty/araw)
git pull origin qa
npm install  # if package.json changed
npm run build
pm2 restart araw-dashboard
```

**SSL & Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ **Nginx**: Reverse proxy configured and stable
- ‚úÖ **SSL**: Let's Encrypt certificate working  
- ‚úÖ **PM2**: Basic ecosystem.config.js proven stable
- ‚úÖ **DNS**: araw-qa.ncience.com pointing correctly

---

## üéØ KEY LESSONS LEARNED

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Never test automation on demo sites** during critical deadlines
2. **Always have working rollback tested** before implementing automation
3. **Use staging environment** for complex deployment system testing
4. **Monitor processes carefully** - PM2 "online" ‚â† application working

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well
1. **Emergency Response**: Quick rollback to stable state
2. **Git Strategy**: QA branch separation allowed clean revert
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive logging helped recovery
4. **Basic Infrastructure**: Simple PM2 + Nginx proven reliable

---

## üîÑ NEXT AGENT PRIORITIES

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Verify Current State**: Ensure https://araw-qa.ncience.com remains stable
2. **Document Findings**: Update any additional observations
3. **Plan Investigation**: Schedule staging environment for automation retry

### Future Automation Work
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Why Next.js hangs in production
2. **Alternative Approaches**: Consider PM2 + standalone build
3. **Staging Environment**: Separate from production for testing
4. **Incremental Implementation**: Build automation piece by piece

---

**FINAL NOTE:** The basic deployment is rock-solid stable. Automation is a "nice-to-have" enhancement that should not risk production stability. Focus on understanding the Next.js issue before attempting re-implementation.
