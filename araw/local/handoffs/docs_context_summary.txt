 

For creating a climate finance dashboard for the Philippines, it is essential to synthesize international obligations, national policies, strategic financial flows, institutional arrangements, and tracking mechanisms described in the attached documents. Below is a structured summary of the most important elements to consider, directly relevant to dashboard design and content. 

Shape 

Core Principles and International Alignment 

The Philippines’ commitments are anchored in the Paris Agreement, specifically the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities, and the need for both mitigation and adaptation—with a critical focus on adaptation for developing countries. 

The Paris Agreement emphasizes: tracking financial flows, supporting developing nations with finance, technology, and capacity, transparency in reporting, and a global framework for adaptation and climate finance.

National Policy Frameworks 

The National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2011–2028 prioritizes adaptation as the anchor strategy, with explicit outcomes and outputs for food security, water sufficiency, ecological stability, human security, climate-smart industries, sustainable energy, and knowledge/capacity development. 

It outlines requirements for cross-cutting actions: gender, research, tech transfer, IEC, capacity-building. 

Highlights the need for innovative financing (debt swaps, disaster funds, public/private finance, payments for ecosystem services). 

The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) 2023–2050 identifies 8 sectors (agriculture, water, health, biodiversity, cultural heritage, land/human settlements, livelihoods/industry, energy/transport/communications) each with adaptation and finance needs. 

The NAP explicitly prioritizes the need to mobilize domestic, international, and private finance, noting current gaps in bankability, information, capacity, and enabling policies for adaptation funding. 

The NDC Implementation Plan builds on the above, operationalizing the Philippines’ 75% GHG reduction/avoidance target (2020–2030), of which 2.7% is unconditional (domestically financed) and 72.3% is conditional (dependent on international support), as submitted to the UNFCCC. 

Defines Policies and Measures (PAMs) for all main sectors, and identifies corresponding finance and capacity needs.

Climate Finance Flows and Sources 

Three main finance sources for adaptation and mitigation: 

Domestic public funding (national and LGU budgets, People’s Survival Fund, climate expenditure tagging) 

International development funding (Green Climate Fund, GEF, MDBs, bilateral ODA, adaptation funds) 

Private sector finance (sustainable bonds, loan programs, PPPs, banking regulation, green investments). 

Recent budgets: from 2016–2022, PHP 1.59 trillion allocated to climate initiatives; 94.5% to adaptation. 

International support: key donors include Japan, World Bank, GCF; but funding is still heavily loans (vs. grants) and leaves a major gap for adaptation projects. 

Private sector: Growing relevance but still underrepresented. Policies are in place to incentivize engagement (Sustainable Finance Framework, Green Jobs Act, banking regulations). 

Shape 

Institutional Structure and Governance 

Climate Change Commission (CCC): Lead policy and coordination agency for strategy, finance tracking, and MRV (measurement, reporting, verification). 

Departmental Roles: DA, DENR, DOE, DOTr (sector leads for NDC/MRV), DOF (climate finance), DBM (budget tagging). 

Coordination mechanisms: Interagency Green Force on Sustainable Finance, National Steering Committees for NDC/NAP delivery. 

Local Government Units (LGUs): Frontline in project proposal, implementation, and local adaptation finance flows. 

Shape 

Tracking and Transparency Mechanisms 

Climate Change Expenditure Tagging (CCET): Tracks climate-tagged expenditures in national budgets, allocates/domesticates public finance, and increasingly links to NDC/MRV actions. 

Project-based MRV: Progress, impact, and finance for each policy/measure tracked by sectoral leads and reported at national level (including GHG impact, adaptation outcomes, and finance received/disbursed). 

Enhancement plans: Future versions will include robust tracking for all sources (domestic, private, international, PPP), outcomes (mitigation, adaptation), and compliance with Paris Agreement Article 13. 

Shape 

Key Recommendations and Barriers 

Barriers: Gaps in technical capacity, awareness, bankability of projects (esp. for LGUs), complexity of accessing funds, need for simplified procedures, harmonized standards, insufficient private sector engagement, and lack of full sector coverage in budgeting and policy alignment. 

Recommended improvements: 

Finalize a national climate investment and financing strategy. 

Establish or strengthen a focal entity for climate finance oversight. 

Expand/enhance CCET for full integration with MRV and international standards. 

Prioritize communication, capacity-building (esp. for LGUs and CSOs), and transparency portals for finance tracking. 

Shape 

What to Include on the Dashboard 

Aggregate figures: Allocation, disbursement, and gaps for adaptation and mitigation finance by source (public, international, private). 

Project pipeline/status: Ongoing, completed, and proposed adaptation/mitigation projects; highlight sector, region, finance source, expected/actual impact. 

CCET & budget flows: Visualize climate-tagged expenditures, NDC policy/measure finance, LGU disbursement, and PSF status. 

Donor/partnership tracking: Sources, volume, sector, and type (loan/grant) of international climate finance received. 

Private finance flows: Sustainable bonds, green loans, ESG-linked investments. 

MRV overlay: Progress and reporting on NDC/NAP targets, GHG reductions, adaptation co-benefits, financial outcome mapping. 

All data and features should be aligned with NDC, NAP, and NCCAP priorities and support compliance with Paris Agreement requirements for transparency, reporting, and international obligations. 

 

The acronyms NDC and MRV are foundational in climate policy and finance discussions: 

Shape 

NDC: Nationally Determined Contribution 

NDC stands for Nationally Determined Contribution. 

It represents each country's national plan under the Paris Agreement, specifying targets and measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change over a defined period (such as 2020–2030 for the Philippines). 

The Philippine NDC outlines commitments for mitigation and adaptation across key sectors, including specific emission reduction targets and implementation strategies, as submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 

Shape 

MRV: Measurement, Reporting, and Verification 

MRV stands for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification.The-Philippines-NDC-Implementation-Plan-072024.pdf 

It describes the systematic approach and framework for measuring emissions, reporting progress, and verifying the accuracy and transparency of climate actions, including those related to NDC implementation and finance flows. 

MRV is critical for tracking mitigation and adaptation outcomes, financial resource use, and ensuring compliance with both domestic and international climate commitments.
