V3.0 Implementation Session Notes
==================================
Date: 2025-10-22 08:15 PST
Branch: feature/v3.0-implementation

SESSION GOAL:
Review project state, analyze V3.0 mockups, decide implementation strategy

ANALYSIS COMPLETED:
===================

PROJECT STATE REVIEW:
- Reviewed wus_logs.txt (complete history from Sept 9 to Sept 29)
- Current branches: qa (production), dev (broken), main (broken)
- V2.0 deployed and stable at https://araw-qa.ncience.com
- User has new data and final V3.0 mockups ready
- Figma resource from Janika with detailed specifications (not yet reviewed)

BUILD STATUS CHECK:
- dev branch: Build FAILED (missing InvestmentsByVulnerabilityChart.tsx)
- main branch: Build FAILED (same missing component)
- qa branch: Not checked (production stable, should not modify)

MOCKUP ANALYSIS:
- User provided bird's eye view screenshots
- Shows "Container Spacing" specifications
- Shows "Element & Component Breakdown"
- Appears to be completely different design from V2.0
- More systematic, modern layout approach

RECOMMENDATION PROVIDED:
========================
START FROM SCRATCH - Fresh Implementation

Reasons:
1. V2.0 has different design paradigm (purple theme, different layout)
2. V3.0 mockups show new spacing/layout standards
3. Build errors in dev/main make them poor starting points
4. Clean slate = no V2.0 technical debt
5. Figma details provide exact specifications

User Decision: APPROVED - Option B (Start fresh branch)

ACTIONS TAKEN:
==============
✅ Created new branch: feature/v3.0-implementation from main
✅ Cleaned page.tsx to simple V3.0 foundation page
✅ Verified build passes (117 kB bundle)
✅ Committed: eb462e3 "V3.0 foundation - clean starting point"
✅ Created v3_implementation_plan.txt
✅ Created v3_session_notes.txt (this file)

FOUNDATION PAGE CREATED:
- Simple welcome page explaining V3.0 status
- Lists technical foundation (NextJS, HeroUI, TypeScript)
- Shows implementation approach (screenshot-driven)
- Shows ready status for next steps
- Clean, professional placeholder

NEXT ACTIONS FOR USER/AGENT:
=============================
1. Review Figma resource from Janika
   - Get exact spacing values
   - Get color palette specifications
   - Get typography standards
   - Get component specifications

2. Provide detailed screenshots
   - Section by section
   - Can drill down on each part
   - Agent will implement exactly as shown

3. Iterative development
   - One section at a time
   - User approval before next section
   - Pixel-perfect matching priority

READY FOR: Figma review and detailed screenshot analysis
