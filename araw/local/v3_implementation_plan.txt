ARAW Climate Finance Dashboard - V3.0 Implementation Plan
==========================================================
Date: 2025-10-22
Branch: feature/v3.0-implementation
Status: CLEAN FOUNDATION READY

DECISION: START FROM SCRATCH (Fresh Implementation)
===================================================

REASONING:
- V2.0 (on qa branch) is completely different design paradigm
- V3.0 mockups show systematic container spacing standards
- Clean slate avoids technical debt from V2.0 decisions
- Build errors on dev/main branches (missing components)
- Figma details from Janika provide exact specifications

PRESERVED FROM V2.0:
- NextJS 15.5.3 + HeroUI 2.8.4 + TypeScript stack (proven solid)
- Build/deployment infrastructure knowledge
- AWS EC2 + PM2 + Nginx deployment patterns
- General Recharts/Leaflet integration patterns (if needed)

BRANCH STRATEGY:
===============
- main: Original base (has build errors, but stable structure)
- qa: V2.0 Production (https://araw-qa.ncience.com) - STABLE, DO NOT TOUCH
- dev: Development with build errors - not using for V3.0
- feature/v3.0-implementation: NEW - Fresh V3.0 build (current branch)

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
✅ New branch created: feature/v3.0-implementation
✅ Clean page.tsx foundation implemented
✅ Build passing: 117 kB bundle (clean slate)
✅ Commit: eb462e3 "V3.0 foundation - clean starting point"
✅ Ready for component implementation

NEXT STEPS:
==========
1. Review Figma resource from Janika for exact specifications
   - Container spacing standards
   - Color palette
   - Typography specifications
   - Component breakdown

2. Analyze V3.0 mockup screenshots in detail
   - Identify all sections and components needed
   - Note spacing, colors, layouts
   - Create component inventory

3. Implement section by section
   - Start with header/navigation
   - Then filters/sidebar (if applicable)
   - KPI cards with new design
   - Charts following new layout
   - Test each section before moving to next

4. User feedback loop
   - Show each section as completed
   - Get approval before moving forward
   - Pixel-perfect matching as priority

TECHNICAL STACK (Preserved):
===========================
- Frontend: NextJS 15.5.3 + React 19.1.0
- UI Library: HeroUI 2.8.4
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- TypeScript: Full type safety
- Charts: Recharts (if similar visualizations needed)
- Maps: Leaflet + react-leaflet (if needed)

DEPLOYMENT PLAN (When Ready):
=============================
- Local testing first: npm run dev
- Build verification: npm run build
- Deploy to new subdomain: araw-v3-qa.ncience.com
- Keep V2.0 stable on araw-qa.ncience.com during V3.0 development

READY FOR: Figma review and screenshot-driven implementation
