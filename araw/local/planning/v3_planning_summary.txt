Estimated Timeline: 4-5 weeks with 1-2 developers


DATA REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED:
==============================
Core Data Entities:
1. Projects (with metadata)
2. Investments/Funding (amounts, types, sources)
3. Sectors (NAP: 8, NDCIP: 5)
4. Regions (17 Philippine regions)
5. Organizations (Funders & Implementing Agencies)
6. GHG Data (historical and projections)
7. Climate Impact Drivers (4 types)
8. Income Classifications (5 classes)

Data Sources Referenced:
- National CCET PAPs Figures 2017 - GAA FY2025
- NICCDIES data (1994, 2000, 2010, 2020)
- Climate Budget Brief - GAA v.21
- Green Climate Fund data
- NAP 2023-2050 documents
- CCC documents

Note: Most data not yet available in DOF spreadsheets
      Current specs based on existing mockups and online sources
      Requires validation from user


KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
=========================
âœ… Fresh start approach (not building on V2.0)
âœ… Keep existing tech stack: NextJS 15.5.3 + HeroUI 2.8.4 + TypeScript
âœ… Use Recharts for all visualizations
âœ… Reuse Leaflet/react-leaflet for map (from V2.0 patterns)
âœ… Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
âœ… Mock data first, then real data integration
âœ… Component-based architecture with reusable patterns
âœ… Filter state management with React Context
âœ… API-ready structure for future backend integration


NEXT STEPS - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
=======================================

IMMEDIATE (You can start now):
1. Review all documentation files in local/v3_*.txt
2. Approve the work breakdown and epic/ticket structure
3. Decide which epic to start with (recommend EPIC-01: Foundation)
4. Provide any clarifications or adjustments needed

THEN (Agent will proceed):
5. Agent implements EPIC-01: Foundation
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Design system constants
   - Mock data generators
   - Utility functions
6. Agent implements EPIC-02: Header
7. Continue epic by epic with your approval


DATA COLLECTION NEEDS:
======================
For real data integration (Phase 2-3):
- [ ] CCET PAPs funding data (2017-2025)
- [ ] Project database (for metrics calculation)
- [ ] Investment by sector breakdown
- [ ] Regional allocation data
- [ ] Fund source categorization
- [ ] NICCDIES GHG data (validated)
- [ ] Funder organization list (complete)
- [ ] Implementing agency list (complete)
- [ ] Climate Impact Driver classifications
- [ ] Income class data by region

Can start with mock data for ALL sections
Real data can be integrated incrementally


QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
==================
1. Do you approve this work breakdown structure?
2. Which epic should we start implementing first?
   Recommendation: EPIC-01 (Foundation) â†’ EPIC-02 (Header) â†’ EPIC-05 (KPI Cards)
3. Do you want to review any specific section in more detail?
4. Any changes to priorities or scope?
5. Do you have any immediate data you can provide, or should we use mock data throughout?


FILES TO REVIEW:
================
Priority 1 (Must Review):
- local/v3_work_breakdown.txt - All epics and tickets
- local/v3_mockup_catalogue.txt - Detailed specifications

Priority 2 (Good to Review):
- local/v3_design_system.txt - Colors, typography, component specs
- local/v3_data_requirements.txt - Data structures and TypeScript interfaces

Priority 3 (Reference):
- local/v3_implementation_plan.txt - High-level strategy
- local/v3_session_notes.txt - Session progress log


PLANNING PHASE: âœ… COMPLETE
===========================
Ready to proceed to implementation when you approve! ðŸš€
