- Total: 63 tickets across 11 epics
- Priority distribution: 38 High, 18 Medium, 7 Low
- Dependencies mapped between epics
- 4-phase implementation sequence planned (4-5 weeks estimated)

### 5. Key Technical Decisions ✅
- Fresh start approach (not building on V2.0 due to different paradigm)
- Preserve tech stack: NextJS 15.5.3 + HeroUI 2.8.4 + TypeScript
- Use Recharts for visualizations
- Reuse Leaflet/react-leaflet patterns for map
- Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Mock data first, real data integration later
- Component-based architecture with reusability
- React Context for filter state management
- API-ready structure for future backend

### 6. Documentation Quality ✅
- All specifications cross-referenced
- Figma annotations integrated into catalogue
- Functional requirements from notes document captured
- NAP vs NDCIP differences documented
- Filter alignment per section documented
- Data source limitations noted
- Future implementation considerations included

## COMMITS MADE:
1. eb462e3 - V3.0 foundation - clean starting point for fresh implementation
2. 70041fe - V3.0 planning structure - catalogue, work breakdown, data requirements
3. d054af3 - V3.0 complete specifications - design system, catalogue, data requirements
4. 061a06a - V3.0 complete JIRA-style work breakdown - 11 epics, 63 tickets
5. 26f3d8e - V3.0 planning phase summary and next steps

## KEY FINDINGS FROM ANNOTATIONS:
- NAP has 8 sectors, NDCIP has 5 sectors (affects sector display)
- Fund sourcing varies between NAP and NDCIP views
- Amount vs Projects toggle affects violet KPI card only
- Ongoing vs Completed toggle updates project counts
- Filters aligned by section function (different filters per section type)
- Most data not yet available in DOF spreadsheets (compiled from online sources)
- Data still needs validation
- Map can be static initially (per Oct 3, 2025 meeting notes)
- Vulnerability Index replaced with NAP Climate Impact Drivers

## DELIVERABLES STATUS:
✅ Design system extraction (COMPLETE)
✅ Mockup catalogue (COMPLETE - 9 sections)
✅ Data requirements (COMPLETE - 11 data sections)
✅ Work breakdown (COMPLETE - 11 epics, 63 tickets)
✅ Implementation strategy (COMPLETE)
✅ Planning summary (COMPLETE)

## READY FOR NEXT PHASE:
User can now:
1. Review all documentation files (local/v3_*.txt)
2. Approve work breakdown structure
3. Decide starting epic (recommended: EPIC-01 Foundation)
4. Provide any clarifications or adjustments

Agent will then:
1. Implement approved epics one by one
2. Get user approval before moving to next epic
3. Integrate data as user provides it
4. Build incrementally with continuous feedback

**PLANNING PHASE STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE**
**NEXT PHASE: Implementation (awaiting user approval to proceed)**
