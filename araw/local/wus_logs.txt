SWUS - 2025-10-22 (Wednesday 08:15 PST) - V3.0 Planning & Specification Phase
==============================================================================

Starting new work unit session for V3.0 mockup analysis and implementation planning.

**Working Branch**: feature/v3.0-implementation (NEW)
**Current Date**: 2025-10-22 08:15:08 PST (Philippines)

Goals:
- Review project state and wus logs
- Analyze V3.0 mockups from Janika's Figma designs
- Decide implementation approach (fresh start vs continuation)
- Create comprehensive specifications from mockups
- Break down work into JIRA-style epics and tickets
- Document all requirements systematically

## PROJECT STATE REVIEW COMPLETED ✅
**Branches Analyzed:**
- qa (production): V2.0 stable at https://araw-qa.ncience.com
- dev: Has build errors (missing components)
- main: Similar build errors
- feature/v3.0-redesign: Previous V3.0 planning started

**Decision Made:** Start from scratch with new implementation branch

## ACTIONS COMPLETED:

### 1. Branch Setup ✅
- Created: feature/v3.0-implementation from main
- Clean page.tsx foundation created

- Typography: Inter font family, sizes 13-48px, various weights
- 10 major components documented with full specifications
- Component-specific colors for KPI cards (5 gradients)
- Chart color palettes extracted
- Spacing and layout standards documented

**Mockup Catalogue (v3_mockup_catalogue.txt):**
- 9 major sections fully documented:
  01. Header (teal bar with logo, title, timestamp, icons)
  02. Subheader (NAP/NDCIP toggle, sector chips, action buttons)
  03. Side Panel (filters sidebar with collapsible sections)
  04. Key Metric Cards (5 gradient KPI cards)
  05. Financing & Emissions Trends (2 charts)
  06. Climate Investment Overview (sector chart + fund source cards)
  07. GHG Baseline by Sector (stacked bar chart)
  08. Regional Investments & Map (horizontal bars + choropleth)
  09. Footer (teal bar with logos and social links)
- Every component catalogued with:
  • Visual elements (O1, O2, O3 annotations)
  • Colors (hex codes)
  • Typography (sizes, weights)
  • Layout specs (dimensions, spacing)
  • Data requirements
  • Interactions

**Data Requirements (v3_data_requirements.txt):**
- 11 major data requirement sections documented
- TypeScript interface specifications for all data structures
- Sample data structures provided
- Data sources identified (CCET PAPs, NICCDIES, GCF, etc.)
- Relationships between entities mapped
- API endpoint structure planned
- 3-phase data collection strategy outlined

**Work Breakdown (v3_work_breakdown.txt):**
- 11 Epics created:
  • EPIC-01: Project Foundation & Setup (4 tickets)
  • EPIC-02: Header Component (4 tickets)
  • EPIC-03: Subheader & Filter Controls (4 tickets)
  • EPIC-04: Side Panel (6 tickets)
  • EPIC-05: Key Metric Cards (7 tickets)
  • EPIC-06: Chart Visualizations (4 tickets)
  • EPIC-07: Investment & GHG Charts (4 tickets)
  • EPIC-08: Regional Investments & Map (6 tickets)
  • EPIC-09: Data Integration & State Management (4 tickets)
  • EPIC-10: Footer & Global Layout (4 tickets)
  • EPIC-11: Responsive Design & Polish (7 tickets)
- Total: 63 tickets across 11 epics
- Priority distribution: 38 High, 18 Medium, 7 Low
- Dependencies mapped between epics
- 4-phase implementation sequence planned (4-5 weeks estimated)

### 5. Key Technical Decisions ✅
- Fresh start approach (not building on V2.0 due to different paradigm)
- Preserve tech stack: NextJS 15.5.3 + HeroUI 2.8.4 + TypeScript
- Use Recharts for visualizations
- Reuse Leaflet/react-leaflet patterns for map
- Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Mock data first, real data integration later
- Component-based architecture with reusability
- React Context for filter state management
- API-ready structure for future backend

### 6. Documentation Quality ✅
- All specifications cross-referenced
- Figma annotations integrated into catalogue
- Functional requirements from notes document captured
- NAP vs NDCIP differences documented
- Filter alignment per section documented
- Data source limitations noted
- Future implementation considerations included

## COMMITS MADE:
1. eb462e3 - V3.0 foundation - clean starting point for fresh implementation
2. 70041fe - V3.0 planning structure - catalogue, work breakdown, data requirements
3. d054af3 - V3.0 complete specifications - design system, catalogue, data requirements
4. 061a06a - V3.0 complete JIRA-style work breakdown - 11 epics, 63 tickets
5. 26f3d8e - V3.0 planning phase summary and next steps

## KEY FINDINGS FROM ANNOTATIONS:
- NAP has 8 sectors, NDCIP has 5 sectors (affects sector display)
- Fund sourcing varies between NAP and NDCIP views
- Amount vs Projects toggle affects violet KPI card only
- Ongoing vs Completed toggle updates project counts
- Filters aligned by section function (different filters per section type)
- Most data not yet available in DOF spreadsheets (compiled from online sources)
- Data still needs validation
- Map can be static initially (per Oct 3, 2025 meeting notes)
- Vulnerability Index replaced with NAP Climate Impact Drivers

## DELIVERABLES STATUS:
✅ Design system extraction (COMPLETE)
✅ Mockup catalogue (COMPLETE - 9 sections)
✅ Data requirements (COMPLETE - 11 data sections)
✅ Work breakdown (COMPLETE - 11 epics, 63 tickets)
✅ Implementation strategy (COMPLETE)
✅ Planning summary (COMPLETE)

## READY FOR NEXT PHASE:
User can now:
1. Review all documentation files (local/v3_*.txt)
2. Approve work breakdown structure
3. Decide starting epic (recommended: EPIC-01 Foundation)
4. Provide any clarifications or adjustments

Agent will then:
1. Implement approved epics one by one
2. Get user approval before moving to next epic
3. Integrate data as user provides it
4. Build incrementally with continuous feedback

**PLANNING PHASE STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE**
**NEXT PHASE: Implementation (awaiting user approval to proceed)**
