## WUS #5 - Dashboard Mockup Implementation (9/11/2025)
**Status:** CRITICAL WORKSPACE ROOT ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Goal:** Implement first mockup section (purple header, KPI cards, charts) to match user screenshot exactly

### Progress Completed:
1. ✅ Updated page.tsx with purple header (`bg-purple-800 text-white`)
2. ✅ Implemented custom KPI cards with exact colors and data from mockup
3. ✅ Updated chart components (FundsMobilizedChart, GHGLevelsChart) with proper styling
4. ✅ Fixed all build errors and component imports
5. ✅ Created next.config.ts to resolve workspace root issues

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED 🎯
**Problem:** User working in WRONG Cursor workspace root directory!

**Evidence:**
- File contains correct purple header code but browser shows white header
- Next.js workspace root confusion (multiple package-lock.json files)
- Development server not detecting file changes
- Persistent caching despite all troubleshooting attempts

**Troubleshooting Steps Attempted:**
- Cleared .next cache multiple times
- Killed/restarted npm run dev processes
- Hard browser refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Created next.config.ts with turbopack root configuration
- Moved conflicting package-lock.json from parent directory

**SOLUTION IDENTIFIED:** 
Close Cursor and reopen with correct workspace root:
`/Users/carlomanuelmolina/Data/Code/UBQTY/araw/climate-finance-dashboard`

**Expected Result:** Purple header should work immediately once Cursor workspace is correct

### Next Steps After Workspace Fix:
- Verify purple header displays correctly
- Continue with mockup section 2 implementation using screenshots


=============================================================================

**EWUS - 2025-09-11 - WUS #5 SESSION COMPLETE** 🎯
