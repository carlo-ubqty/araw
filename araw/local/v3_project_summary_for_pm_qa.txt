QUALITY ASSURANCE TESTING SEQUENCE:
====================================

For Lei - QA Testing Approach:
-------------------------------
Each section will be developed and deployed to QA environment sequentially.
After Lei approves a section, development continues on the next section.

Testing Environment: araw-v3-qa.ncience.com (to be set up)
Testing Devices: Desktop (Chrome, Firefox), iPad, iPhone

General QA Checks for All Sections:
- Visual accuracy compared to Figma mockups
- Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- No console errors in browser developer tools
- Loading states (if applicable)
- Data displays correctly (using mock data initially)
- No broken images or missing assets
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Readable text (contrast, font sizes)
- All interactive elements functional
- No overlapping elements
- Smooth animations/transitions


JIRA TICKET SUMMARY (9 Tickets):
=================================
ARAW-301: Section 1 - Header Component (1 day)
ARAW-302: Section 2 - Subheader & Filter Controls (2 days)
ARAW-303: Section 3 - Side Panel Filters (2 days)
ARAW-304: Section 4 - Key Metric Cards (2 days)
ARAW-305: Section 5 - Financing & Emissions Charts (3 days)
ARAW-306: Section 6 - Climate Investment Overview (3 days)
ARAW-307: Section 7 - GHG Baseline by Sector (2 days)
ARAW-308: Section 8 - Regional Investments & Map (5 days)
ARAW-309: Section 9 - Footer Component (1 day)

Total Development Time: ~21 days (4-5 weeks with testing cycles)


DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW:
====================
1. Developer completes section on local environment
2. Developer runs build and basic tests
3. Deploy to araw-v3-qa.ncience.com
4. Lei receives notification for QA testing
5. Lei tests section using checklist above
6. Lei reports bugs/issues (if any) or approves section
7. Developer fixes bugs (if any) and redeploys
8. Once approved, move to next section

After All Sections Complete:
- Full integration testing by Lei
- Responsive design testing across devices
- Performance testing
- Final bug fixes
- Deploy to production (araw-qa.ncience.com or new domain)


DATA APPROACH:
==============
Phase 1 (All Sections): Use mock/realistic data
Phase 2 (After UI Complete): Integrate real data as Carlo provides it

Mock data will be realistic and follow the actual data structures, so the 
transition to real data will be smooth.


DEPENDENCIES & RISKS:
=====================
Low Risk:
- Technical stack is proven (NextJS + HeroUI + TypeScript)
- Clean fresh start minimizes technical debt
- Section-by-section approach allows for course correction

Medium Risk:
- Map component complexity (Section 8) - most time-consuming
- Data integration when moving from mock to real data

Mitigation:
- Allocate extra time for Section 8 (map)
- Keep data structures well-documented for smooth integration


NOTES FOR PM (Jhonnel):
========================
- Development will be iterative with QA checkpoints after each section
- If any section needs changes, it can be adjusted before moving to next section
- Estimated timeline includes QA cycles, but not extensive bug fixing
- Timeline may extend if significant changes requested after QA
- All sections use mock data initially; real data integration is Phase 2


NOTES FOR QA (Lei):
===================
- Each section will be deployed independently for testing
- Use provided checklists for each section
- Compare visual output to Figma mockups (available in project files)
- Test on multiple devices: Desktop (Chrome, Firefox), Tablet, Mobile
- Focus on functionality and visual accuracy first
- Performance testing can come later in integration phase
- Report bugs/issues in JIRA ticket comments
- Approval needed before development proceeds to next section


CONTACT & COLLABORATION:
=========================
Questions or clarifications:
- Technical: Carlo + Agent
- Design/Mockups: Janika (Figma designs)
- Data: Carlo (will provide when available)
- PM: Jhonnel
- QA: Lei

All specifications and detailed documentation available in:
/local/v3_*.txt files in the project repository


PROJECT START DATE: October 22, 2025
ESTIMATED COMPLETION: Late November 2025 (4-5 weeks)
CURRENT STATUS: Planning Complete, Ready to Start Development
