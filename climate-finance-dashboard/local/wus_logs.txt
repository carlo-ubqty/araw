SWUS - 2025-09-09 - New project start: ARAW technical review and sprint planning
=============================================================================

Starting new work unit session for ARAW project review and technical implementation planning.

Goals:
- Review DOF document for technical requirements
- Provide technical implementation analysis for sprint planning
- Identify key components and frameworks needed

Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Get the correct date (2025-09-09)
2. ‚úÖ Review DOF document content (DOF_Sep9.txt analyzed)
3. ‚úÖ Provide technical implementation analysis

Key Findings:
- 165+ data integration points from 20+ government agencies
- Estimated timeline: 24-30 weeks (6-7.5 months)
- Highest risk: Data integration complexity
- Recommended: Phased approach with MVP in 8 weeks
- Technology stack: React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Python backend
- Infrastructure: Government cloud with microservices architecture

Status: COMPLETE - Ready for sprint planning

Additional Deliverable:
‚úÖ Created ARAW_Technical_Planning_Notes.txt for project manager review

Update: Data sources clarification received
‚ö†Ô∏è  Most data will be from Excel sheets (not APIs as initially assumed)
‚úÖ Updated ARAW_Technical_Planning_Notes.txt with Excel vs DB recommendations
   - Recommended hybrid approach: Excel first ‚Üí selective normalization ‚Üí full DB
   - Updated technology stack for Excel processing (Pandas/SheetJS)
   - Added implementation timeline and risk mitigation strategies

EWUS - 2025-09-09 - Technical review and planning completed
===========================================================

Summary: Successfully completed technical review of DOF document and provided comprehensive sprint planning recommendations including Excel vs database architecture analysis.

State at EWUS:
- Technical planning document created for project manager
- Architecture recommendations provided (hybrid Excel‚ÜíDB approach)
- Sprint planning strategy defined (3 phases, 24-30 weeks)
- Technology stack recommendations documented
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies outlined

SWUS - 2025-09-11 - Application Bootstrap and Initial Development
================================================================

Starting new work unit session for ARAW Climate Finance Dashboard development.

Goals:
- Bootstrap initial app using specified tech stack (NextJS, PostgreSQL, TypeScript)
- Implement initial mockup from v2.0_Climate_Finance_Dashboard_09102025.pdf
- Set up local development environment and testing
- Prepare for AWS EC2/RDS deployment

Tech Stack (from SOPs):
- NodeJS + NextJS (+ HeroUI)
- Python (data processing)
- PostgreSQL
- TypeScript
- Ubuntu, Nginx, PM2

Steps Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Get correct date (2025-09-11)
2. ‚úÖ Initialize git repository in /Users/carlomanuelmolina/Data/Code/UBQTY/araw
3. ‚úÖ Bootstrap NextJS app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router
4. ‚úÖ Install and configure HeroUI (replaced deprecated NextUI)
5. ‚úÖ Install additional dependencies (PostgreSQL, Recharts, Lucide, Next-Auth)
6. ‚úÖ Configure tailwind.config.ts with HeroUI integration
7. ‚úÖ Create HeroUI providers for React context
8. ‚úÖ Update layout.tsx with proper metadata and provider wrapper
9. ‚úÖ Create comprehensive env_log.txt with all setup commands
10. ‚úÖ Start development server (running on localhost:3001 - port 3000 was in use)
11. ‚úÖ Reorganize folder structure - moved all planning docs to app/local directory
12. ‚úÖ Clean up old local folder from parent directory (removed duplicate folder)

Tech Stack Confirmed:
- NextJS 15.5.3 + React 19.1.0 + TypeScript
- HeroUI 2.8.4 (modern UI framework)
- PostgreSQL with pg client
- Recharts for data visualization
- Authentication ready (Next-Auth)

## WUS #5 - Dashboard Mockup Implementation (9/11/2025)
**Status:** CRITICAL WORKSPACE ROOT ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Goal:** Implement first mockup section (purple header, KPI cards, charts) to match user screenshot exactly

### Progress Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Updated page.tsx with purple header (`bg-purple-800 text-white`)
2. ‚úÖ Implemented custom KPI cards with exact colors and data from mockup
3. ‚úÖ Updated chart components (FundsMobilizedChart, GHGLevelsChart) with proper styling
4. ‚úÖ Fixed all build errors and component imports
5. ‚úÖ Created next.config.ts to resolve workspace root issues

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED üéØ
**Problem:** User working in WRONG Cursor workspace root directory!

**Evidence:**
- File contains correct purple header code but browser shows white header
- Next.js workspace root confusion (multiple package-lock.json files)
- Development server not detecting file changes
- Persistent caching despite all troubleshooting attempts

**Troubleshooting Steps Attempted:**
- Cleared .next cache multiple times
- Killed/restarted npm run dev processes
- Hard browser refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Created next.config.ts with turbopack root configuration
- Moved conflicting package-lock.json from parent directory

**SOLUTION IDENTIFIED:** 
Close Cursor and reopen with correct workspace root:
`/Users/carlomanuelmolina/Data/Code/UBQTY/araw/climate-finance-dashboard`

**Expected Result:** Purple header should work immediately once Cursor workspace is correct

### Next Steps After Workspace Fix:
- Verify purple header displays correctly
- Continue with mockup section 2 implementation using screenshots
